# Fingerprint-Vehicle-Starter
Our team developed a fingerprint vehicle starter project where we connected a fingerprint sensor module to an Arduino following its datasheet instructions. We ensured proper connections for power (Vcc, GND) and data lines (TX/RX), and included a current-limiting resistor along with two LEDs connected to digital pins on the Arduino. These LEDs visually indicate the status of fingerprint verification: a blue LED lights up upon a successful match, while a red LED indicates an unrecognized fingerprint. Additionally, we integrated a relay module between the DC motor and a power supply, ensuring sufficient power for all components (Arduino, fingerprint sensor, LEDs, and motor). Upon successful fingerprint verification, our system triggers the motor control circuit, initiating motor rotation. The Arduino actively triggers the relay and sends a signal to activate the motor. For this project, we employed a DC motor to demonstrate its functionality as the output mechanism.
